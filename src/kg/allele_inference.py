"""Link an annotation about an rsID to the one alt allele it actually studied.

An rsID names a site, often with several alternative alleles. PharmGKB
annotations report the alleles or genotypes they compared (``CT`` vs ``CC``).
When those bases are pure nucleotides, all belong to the site's GRCh38
reference + alt alleles on the forward strand, and exactly one alt appears,
that alt is the variant the annotation is about. Otherwise nothing is
inferred and the reason is recorded.

Bases outside {ref} ∪ alts are counted as ``allele_strand_mismatch``: that
count is the empirical check that PharmGKB alleles are on the forward strand.
The check is blind where the reverse complement of the report is also
consistent with the site (palindromic C/G, A/T sites; four-allele sites). If
that flipped reading would implicate a different variant, nothing is linked
(``strand_ambiguous``).
